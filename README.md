# The Cuicui Data Zoo

A collection of data structures used in `cuicui_richtext`.
Mostly used for dependency resolution and specialized graph traversal tasks.

Note that this library doesn't work on 16 bits plateforms.
If you need support, consider opening an issue.

## Features

- `enumset`: enables the [`enumset`] dependency and the `EnumBitMatrix`
  `EnumMultimap` data structures

## Limitations

- Data structures are **untested with sizes `> u32::MAX`**
- Effort is made to panic in those situations though, but you never know
- Generally assumes `size_of(usize) >= size_of(u32)`, effort is made to use
  `u32::try_from(usize).unwrap()` though!
- No `#[no_std]` but I don't see why this couldn't be added as a feature
- depends on `sorted-iter`, can't disable dependency.

## Data structures

This is a collection of [multimaps], [jagged arrays], [bit sets],
and combination thereof.
